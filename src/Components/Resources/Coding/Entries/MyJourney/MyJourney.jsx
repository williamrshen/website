				Growing up, I didn't have too much to my name. Sure, I had some
				achievements in table tennis, but nothing to prove my status as an
				academic warrior. I had some math contest results, but nothing
				specatacular. So in January of grade 11, my parents signed me up for
				some competitive programming classes, hoping I would do well in that.
				Now I had coded a bit in middle school, with block programming, but
				hadn't found much joy in it. So I expected to not finding much interest
				in coding class.
				<br /> <br />
				And I didn't enjoy it the most to begin with. It was somewhat confusing,
				all these variables and loops. Like, what's the point of a variable when
				we can just use the value? I was using Java as well, which had a bunch
				of things to type that I didn't understand. But I stayed consistent and
				kept attending the online classes, often with my dad beside me since he
				could explain what was going on. In February, just one month after
				starting competitive programming, I did the CCC Junior division, and
				scored 62/75, which I was very happy with. Although this didn't score me
				any awards, I was happy with this high score despite my lack of
				experience.
				<br /> <br />
				Then I switched to another class, with another teacher. And for some
				reason, I began to enjoy it more, maybe because I was starting to
				understand Each week I looked forward to attending class, and would
				think about the homework problems whenever I could. I slowly progressed
				and learned various topics until grade 12, when I began to muse about
				problem ideas myself. This led me and 2 of my coding class friends to
				create a{" "}
				<a href="https://dmoj.ca/contest/mccc4j">mock CCC junior contest</a>,
				which turned out to be the most participated contest on DMOJ. I had a
				lot of fun learning about how to generate test data, test edge cases,
				hack solutions, writing problems statements, and just a lot about
				problem setting in general. Although there were some technical
				difficulties (something went wrong with the test cases), it was overall
				very enjoyable. I contributed two problems to the contest,{" "}
				<a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/mccc4j1">P1</a> and{" "}
				<a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/mccc4j4">P4</a>, and remember being
				especially proud of the latter. This was also about the time I switched
				from Java to C++, in January of 2022.
				<br /> <br />
				I took the CCC again in Feburary 2022, this time the senior division. I
				scored 39/75, which was one point off of Honour Roll (188 out of 3262
				contestants). I was a bit bummed, but 1 point is not easy to get, so it
				was alright. I still enjoyed making problems, and tried to set another
				contest with some other friends. That didn't end up succesful though,
				and sometimes when I go on DMOJ I still see those in the works problems
				just laying around.
				<br /> <br />
				The content in the class soon got hard for me. Not that it wasn't
				before, but now even with solutions, I couldn't code the ideas myself.
				So I began to lose motivation and decline. I took CCC Senior in 2023
				again, and scored 34/75, this time 5 points off of Honour Roll. Both
				times I got the Distinction Award, so I was satisfied. After this CCC, I
				basically stopped competitive programming. You can see all this on my{" "}
				<a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/uselessleaf">DMOJ activity graph</a> lol.
				<br /> <br />
				I would say I'm retired now. I do teaching sometimes, like at my current
				co-op job, but not often. I think I learned a lot about programming
				through this journey though. The obvious being basic programming
				concepts like conditionals and recursionm, and the not so obvious being
				things like resilience, where to find code LOL, among others. It was
				very fun while it lasted, and I don't think I've ever had that much fun
				doing something "academic". It is unfortunate that I didn't reach the
				very top, and am basically just barely above average, but nonetheless,
				it has grown me a lot. I feel like without that experience I would not
				be able to code this website, or much else either. I'm grateful to my
				parents for signing me up for that class. And shoutout to all my coding
				friends I've made along the way here, you know who you are.
				<br /> <br />I hope to upload some guides on some simpler topics here.
				Hope you guys will stick around to check it out :)
